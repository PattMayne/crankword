## TODO:
* Invalid Refresh Token should send user to login page.
* * Right now it just sends to error page.
* * We need a redirect flow which goes from needs-login to login back to current_game
* * Deal with refresh_token timing out DURING gameplay
* Find a way to share games or find games.
* * * Open games page
* * * If game is NOT open, non-invited users cannot visit
* Main page must actually look good
* * Pictures of the gameplay style
